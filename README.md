Last updated: October 2025
GlowSkin respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use the GlowSkin mobile app. By using GlowSkin, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

Profile data: answers from skin-type or lifestyle questionnaires (e.g., skin concerns, goals).
Photos or scans: optional images of your face or product ingredient lists, used to analyze skin or extract text.
Account info: if you create an account (name, email, or social login).
Feedback or support messages you send us.
1.2 Information collected automatically
Device type, app version, and anonymous usage analytics (e.g., session length, button clicks).

2. How We Use Your Information
We use your data to:
Provide personalized skincare insights and product recommendations.

Your photos are processed on-device whenever possible. If on-device analysis fails, you may be asked for consent to process the image on our secure servers.
3. Face Data and Image Processing 
GlowSkin may analyze photos that include your face to evaluate visible skin features such as dryness, oiliness, or blemishes.
This analysis is used only to generate cosmetic and skincare insights.
No biometric identifiers (face geometry, facial recognition, or identity data) are collected or stored.
Processing: Images are analyzed on-device whenever possible. If cloud analysis is required, they are securely uploaded to our Google Cloud/Firebase server, processed in memory, and deleted automatically after analysis.
Retention: Images are not stored permanently or linked to your identity.
Sharing: GlowSkin does not share facial images or analysis data with third parties except secure AI processing infrastructure (Google Cloud).
Control: You can revoke camera or photo access at any time in device settings or delete your account to remove all associated data.
(This section addresses Apple Guideline 2.1 on sensitive face data.)

We may share limited data with:
Service providers (e.g., Firebase, Google Cloud Vision, or analytics tools) that help us operate the app.
Amazon Affiliate Program, when you click a ‚ÄúBuy on Amazon‚Äù link (Amazon receives normal referral data).
All such partners are bound by confidentiality and data-processing agreements.
5. Affiliate Disclosure
